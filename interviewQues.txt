counter 

const [counter,setcounter]=usestate(15)


const addvalues=()=>{
    setcounter(counter+1)
    setcounter(counter+1)
    setcounter(counter+1)
    setcounter(counter+1)
}

ğŸ”´Expected Result: counter should increase by 4 (from 15 to 19).
ğŸŸ¢ Actual Result: counter increases only by 1 (from 15 to 16)


Why Does This Happen?

React Batches State Updates

React groups multiple state updates when they are based on the same previous state.
Since counter does not update immediately, each setCounter(counter + 1) still sees the old value of counter (15).



const addValues = () => {
    setCounter(prevCounter => prevCounter + 1);
    setCounter(prevCounter => prevCounter + 1);
    setCounter(prevCounter => prevCounter + 1);
    setCounter(prevCounter => prevCounter + 1);
};
